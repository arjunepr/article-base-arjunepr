Just a simple Sails.js Application I made as part of following [Travery Media](https://www.youtube.com/user/TechGuyWeb)'s Sails.js tutorial [series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLillGF-RfqbZIA-9sI3T1uu7d7_CtbwPm).

A simple project. My intent was to get familiar with the patterns made use of by the Sails team and have a rapid-development node framework in my toolbelt.

Feel free to use the code as you see fit.
